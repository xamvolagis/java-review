# Java Review

## Topics

### Writing, Compiling, Running Code
* IDE review
* JVM, overview of roughly what happens when compiling and running a simple program
* Style: brackets, commenting (what we'd like to see as TAs)

### Object-Oriented Design
* Classes, methods, instance variables vs local variables
* Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default [package])
* Encapsulation
* Logical separation of responsibilities (don't have a 200 line main method!)

# IDEs

## What is an IDE?
* An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is an application that provides a comprehensive set of tools to a programmer. 
It consists of a text editor, debugger, compiler and interpreter. 
* Examples of IDEs include Eclipse, IntelliJ, Microsoft Visual Studio and NetBeans.

## Why use them?
* IDEs allow you to efficiently write, test, and debug your code
* They help you manage imports and other messy business, making your life easier!
* Software companies often like their employees to write code on IDEs, because they are faster and may have custom tools for collaboration

## But...
* It's important not to rely too much on IDEs to save you and catch your mistakes. 
* There's nothing wrong with the good old-fashioned, old-school approach of using a text editor and the command line -- in fact, this will make you a better programmer.
